# sim_sql_rows_insert
A python code to bulk generate bulk rows insert in SQL

As part of my laziness, I decided to create a python code to generate in bulk the X number of rows given the columns of a SQL table. The code is some sort linked to a specific schema but can be changed to the appropriate schema if required.
